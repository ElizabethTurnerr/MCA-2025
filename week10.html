    <h1>Week 10 – Similarity and Transcription</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <h2>Task 1: Similarity (Attempt)</h2>
    <p>
  The task asks me to measure how similar different recordings are by extracting 
        audio featuresand creating a similarity matrix. I understand that 
        the matrix would expose me how both versions of Moon River would match, I think seeing the vocals would be interesting. However, I beyond struggled with starting this. I did follow along 
        in these two tasks and can understand why similarity analysis is useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2: Transcription (Reflection)</h2>
    <p>
        This task relates back to Week 2 as audio. I didn't quite manage to complete this process for my own piece, but I did look at examples 
        in class and examples given on the moodle.
