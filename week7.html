   <p>I added genre and explicit CC license to the MEI header. The metadata appears as raw XML on metaRAW.html. To make it nicer I would: Parse the MEI header and render it as an HTML metadata panel (Title, Composer, Genre, License). Use CSS to style the panel (cards or table), add icons for license and links to authority URIs, and hide raw XML. Optionally use JavaScript to load MEI, extract fields by ID, and render accessible HTML with labels and links.
