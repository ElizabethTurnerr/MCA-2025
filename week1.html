    <h1>Week 1 – Identifying My Theme</h1>

    <h2>Task 1 – Choose a Theme</h2>
    <p>
        For this project, I chose to focus on movie soundtracks. I have been a lifelong movie lover, and I was able to narrow my choices down through a process of liminations. I am particularly interested in how music in film creates emotion for audiences,
        and how songs can take on new meanings when they are listened to outside of the film. This led me to choose the song from the cinema classic Breakfast at Tiffany’s as my main piece of analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2 – Current Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        I found very many different versions of “Moon River” online, or instance official releases, karaokes, covers, instrumental covers, and modern interpretations (one of  my favourites) circulating 
        on both Spotify and YouTube. I think it's particularly fascinating how film music continues to evolve even half a century later. Additionally, I am fascinated how music continues to grow after it's debut in the cinema. I will explore how these versions differ in their musical features throughout the next few weeks.
    </p>

    <h2>My Initial Material Collected</h2>
    <p>
        I sourced the original sheet music for “Moon River” to give me symbolic music data. This will allow me to compare the written score with different audio versions later in the project. It also allows for this project to have an authentic feel.
