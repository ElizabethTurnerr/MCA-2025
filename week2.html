    <h1>Week 2 – Music Notation</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <h2>Task - 1 </h2>
    <p>
        This week, For the second week of Labs, I transcribed 10 bars of "Moon River" into MuseScore. I came across challenges such as: aligning rhythms and dotted values. Tools: MuseScore (.mscz) uploaded to /data/MoonRiver.mscz and MusicXML /data/MoonRiver.mxl..
    </p>

    <h2>Editing the Score</h2>
    <p>
        I imported the music and edited 10 bars to correct rhythm and pitch. This task helped me better understand how symbolic data represents melody, harmony, dynamics in structured form.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>
        Admitingly, downloading MuseScore in the first place proved difficulty. However, once that was up and running, MuseScore was easy to use once I understood the basic tools, especially for rhythmic editing. A lot of this required manual adjustment. Overall, this exercise 
        taught me how symbolic music formats like MusicXML and MEI are constructed.

    <h2>Files Produced Accordingly</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="MoonRiver.mscz" download>MuseScore file (.mscz)</a></li>
        <li><a href="MoonRiver.musicxml" download>MusicXML version (.musicxml)</a></li>
        <li><a href="Moon River.mei" download>MEI file (.mei)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Example</h3>
    <p>
        Below is a screenshot of my digitised score in MuseScore:

        I also briefly experimented with Verovio to render symbolic data directly in 
        the browser.
