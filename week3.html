    <h1>Week 3 - Encoding My Musical Score</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <h2>Task Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Looking back on last week, I digitised my chosen piece with the tool MuseScore. This week I explored how we can make notated music accessible to people who might 
        not have appropriate software, by converting the score into different symbolic encoding formats and then rendering it directly on a webpage. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This was my first time working with MusicXML, MEI and Verovio, so it definitely felt 
        a little intimidating at first! However, once I figured out that each format simply stores 
        musical information in a structured text form, in the same way HTML does for websites, it started 
        to feel a bit more familiar. I am aware there can be a lot of issues surrounding this lab.
    </p>

    <h2>Files Exported</h2>
    <p>
        I exported my score to two important standards:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> MusicXML - which I am familiar with </li>
        <li>MEI</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="data/MoonRiver.musicxml" download>Moon River – MusicXML File</a></li>
        <li><a href="data/MoonRiver.mei" download>Moon River – MEI File</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I then uploaded these files into my repository so they are stored and preserved as part 
        of my dataset moving forward. Placing them in my dataset is like a safety blanket for me, and knowing I can refer back to them at any time is beneficial. 
    </p>

    <h2>Rendering My Score Online</h2>
    <p>
       Note: Verovio can be tempromental. 
        <a href="verovio.html">Verovio page here</a> so it displays my <em>Moon River</em> MEI file.
        It was satisfying to see my digitised score appear online without needing
        any extra notation software. I think this ties in well with my theme, as it is able to standtime and be accesible for movie lovers/those who are not familair with music softwear.
       Overall, MusicXML feels more universal and simple. Infact, I was familiar with XML beforehand... whereas MEI 
        seems designed for archives/libraries and long-term preservation.
