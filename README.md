\Week 1: Theme, Fundamentals and Challengess

I was inspired by the score Moon River from Breakfast at Tiffany's 1961. Vocals by Audrey Hepburn, the film and fashion icon. My interest in film and artistic design can allow me to incoperate elements of cinema into my work. Moon River is a song that has been remixed, covered and pulled inspiration from. A favourite of mine is Frank Ocean's Moon River 2018, a contemporary R&B cover of the song. Another popular 'Frank' who has covered Moon River is Frank Sinatra in 1964. 

Due to the huge success and legacy of Moon River, I will face challeneges with copyright, as scores are heavily copyrighted as they are, nevermind a score being pulled from a film. Scores in films are not always the eact version or same score as the original. For instance, it may be shortened, repeated or remixed. Additionally, ther are multiple versions/arrangements; metadata inconsistency between archives; varied file formats (score, MIDI, audio). Lastly, I have very little to none experience in coding and I find this all a little overwhelming and daunting, however since we are dealing with music data, and that is the key topic, I am sure I will find some familiaity and comfort in music sheets and design etc.

I will collect notated scores, metadata, and audio recordings for versions of "Moon River".]
