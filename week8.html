    <h1>Week 8 – Audio Features Reflection</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <h2>Task 1 – Noting the Features for my table: Audrey Hepburn vs Frank Ocean</h2>
        <li>Timbre: strings + orchestra vs. layered + vocals and soft ambient sounds.</li>
        <li>Tempo: slow vs. even slower </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Task 2 – Sonic Visualiser Attempt</h2>
    <p>
Same as last week, I actually worked with a few classmates to develop someone else's spectogram and histogram. We all evaluated the differences and what each colour symbolised and meant. Comparing the two side by side was effective in noting differences and similarities. Plus, it inspired intersting conversation about why some piece's have louder dynamics and what effect it has on streaming devices and so on.

        Even though I did not get create a visualisation for my own chosen songs. I was still able to see first-hand the process and results of two other songs, and the implications and usefullness of doing so.
