    <h1>Week 7 – Clustering</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <p>
The lraning intention for this week was basically to group songs based on their instruments and similarities, which all sounds very good in theory. However this process of clustering, required intricate coding which I could not quite sucseed in. My technical skills were not high enough to make a result in this, however what I did do was observe my peer, who actually is in my group lab. For both week 7, and week 8, I was able to observe his technical skills and make reflections of my own.

I particularly liked how music can be grouped by emotional impact. I find this SO interesting, as you would believe classical songs make you sad, and rock makes you angry. However, this is not the case, in particularly, when a specific genre is portrayed in film, it sometimes can do the opposite effect. Such as playing classical can evoke an angry emotion... especially if what is being shown visually is quite distressing. Plus, rock music can be used cleverly to create sadness and a meloncholy feeling. This may be due to the music association. However, many chords, or instruments  in a piece can havea a strong emotional connection, proving it isn't just cinema that makes the music emotionally characteristic, but more so the composition as a whole.  
I understand why clustering is used in music analysis as it highlights similarities and differences, however it can be really utilised when looking at it from an academic angle.
       I aim to complete clustering and next week's creating apectrograms and waveforms, when I am more experienced in code.
       However, I am content with my knowledge and understanding of clustering and applying that to my cinematic soundtrack theme and music.
