    <h1>Week 5 – Comparing Audio Versions</h1>
</header>

<main>

    <p>
        This week I decided to compare my original "Moon River" with covers, and I did this audibly. I wanted to hear how the same song changes depending on who performs it. I compared the original 
        film version with a modern cover by Frank Ocean... two different styles. I picked all the Spotify data I possibly could. 
  
        <li>Title & Performer</li>
        <li>Duration (length)</li>
        <li>Release</li>
        <li>Genre or mood</li>

        The most notable/interesting differences to me are - Date = 1961 and 2018 (decades later)
        Genre = film score + ballad + easy listening and R&B + emotional + reinterpretation (complete switch in genre)
        
    </ul>

        Despite having the same melody, both are performed very differently. I enjoyed this week as it focused more on the music itself, how music is meant to be approached.
